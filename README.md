**download python**

**for manage different version of python. I advice you use Virtualenv. For each Django project, you first create a Virtual Environment for it. So you can play around, install packages, uninstall packages without breaking anything.**

```
firstly : sudo pip3 install virtualenv
1縲［kdir myproject 
2縲…d myproject
3縲」irtualenv venv -p python3
4縲《ource venv/bin/activate
if you see(venv) in front of the command line, it worked.
if you want to exit if, you can write "deactivate"


pip install django. (Install django.)

```
# start a new project 
**django-admin startproject myproject**
run the django project 
**python manage.py runserver**
Now open the "http://localhost:8000" and you can see the worked page.
